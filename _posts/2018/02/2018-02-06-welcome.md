Welcome to my new website. This is a place for me to post additional information, when it won't all fit into a video. Or possibly even post plans, at some point in the future.

Also, if you ever want to tell someone how to get to my YouTube videos, you can always tell them to go to TheNewbieWoodworker.com, and follow the links to my YouTube Channel. It's easier than trying to describe how to get to the YouTube channel directly.
