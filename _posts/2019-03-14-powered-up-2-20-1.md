I got the [tongue & groove video](https://youtu.be/dc15zOyLQwg){:target="_blank"} out yesterday, and I got a little more done today. But my posts will be kind of sporadic for a little while, because I managed to slice a finger yesterday, and a thumb today, on the same f'ing chisel blade. That makes it a little difficult to type, and I'm actually a little discouraged for having done 3 dangerously stupid things in the span of a week. So I'm in no hurry to get anything else done for a while.

I've always been a hunt and peck typist, although I'm (usually) pretty fast as long as I don't have to transcribe anything. Turns out I use my left thumb all the time, for pressing the Command key (Control key for you Windows users), which means copy, cut, paste, swapping windows, and other things are affected. Can't I just learn to use my right thumb? Apparently 40 years of habit is (are?) hard to break.

Yesterday, I took all the clamps off after the glue dried on the rails and stiles.

Then I started cleaning up the glue squeeze out.

Here I am, thinking that since my thumb is well out of the way, I'm safe from the chisel plane's blade.

I guess I forgot I had a middle finger.

Well, it's hard to forget now, because it sticks out like a sore, well finger, because I didn't get the thumb until today.

Surprisingly enough, I didn't swear. But I can be heard very clearly, on the video, saying "You have got to be kidding me."

That was it for yesterday.

Today, I cut the slot for the router lift lever, in the two sides of the front panel.

You can see the bandaid on my middle finger.

This is the best picture I have of the two faux doors together, with the slot in the middle.

After I glued and clamped them, I thought I'd start working on version 2 of my chisel plane (the thing that got me yesterday). There was some gunk on the underside of the blade, and I swiped my thumb along the bottom, towards the edge of the blade, so I thought I'd be fine. I thought wrong. I have no idea how I managed to cut myself that way - we've all done that before, with no damage.

Maybe I should call this chisel blade "Audrey II". I wonder how many people will get this reference?

Anyway, I'm going to go lick my wounds.

Later.
