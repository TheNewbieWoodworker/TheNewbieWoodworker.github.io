Got lots of good work done today. It's starting to look an awful lot like a cabinet!

Here's a simplified version of what I did today:

![](/assets/images-posts/powered-up-1/powered-up-1-10-2-01.jpg){: .align-left}

Cut the door back panel, and it was a little big, but I eventually got it the right size.

Then I cut the pegboard to the same size...

![](/assets/images-posts/powered-up-1/powered-up-1-10-2-03.jpg){: .align-left}

...got both of them into the dados...

![](/assets/images-posts/powered-up-1/powered-up-1-10-2-04.jpg){: .align-left}

...eventually got everything aligned right in my corner clamps...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/powered-up-1/powered-up-1-10-2-05.jpg){: .align-left}

...and assembled the frame with screws.

When everything's all hunky-dory, I'll glue it up, but not right now.

Then I did the other door.

Here's what it looks like (without the hinges of course):

It's actually too big for my wall, with both doors open. Fortunately, Steve's design lets me access the inside of the cabinet even when the door is only half-way open.

The doors are just ever so slightly too wide, so tomorrow I'll remove the screws and trim them down just a little.

Then I'll glue them up, and start working on the hinges.

Later.
