title: "A Day of Stupidity - Powered Up! Day 4"

In case you missed [yesterday's post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-22-powered-up-day-3-2 %}), I discovered moisture damage to my stock of plywood:

So today I had to deal with that, so it wouldn't happen again. Here's my cluttered cubby hole:

And here it is, emptied out so I could clean it up:

Here's a SketchUp model of what I'm building:

I finished cutting the 2x4s for the foundation, but not without an unbelievable amount of stupidity. I'm using half-lap joints:

If there was a chance to cut something wrong the first time, I did it. Fortunately, none of the mistakes I made hurt anything in the long run - it just meant I had to cut it again.

But no big deal, except for extreme frustration at my inability to do things right the first time. I'm shooting footage of the process, so I may get a video out of this, which would help alleviate *some* of the pain.

I'll finish the rest tomorrow, knock on plywood, and hopefully get back into the course.

More to come.
