The faux doors are done, glued up, and mostly sanded. I'm waiting on a new forstner bit that arrives tomorrow, before I add the magnets.

Here's a picture, but remember that the lever in this pic is much longer than the one I'll eventually make, so no comments about how you'd hurt you shins, or something else, considering the height of the lever is in this picture.

I've got some other things going on, but I thought I could at least post this.

Later.
