I've got a new article up about how to setup a SawStop PCS T-Glide fence. I'd like any input you might care to give. I already have some changes coming, but I know it's a work in progress.

Here's a [direct link](/sawstop/pcs/fence/setup/).

You can also get there from the [home page](/), by clicking the "SawStop Links" button.
