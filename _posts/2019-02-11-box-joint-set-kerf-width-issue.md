title: "Box Joint set kerf width issue"
---
I'm having a discussion on the [Lumberjocks Forum](http://lumberjocks.com/topics/303107#reply-5186707){:target="_blank"} about a problem I'm having with a box joint blade set. It's cutting a kerf narrower than 1/4", even though I swear it didn't do that before. **And I have the same problem** with an almost-brand-new Dado set that should cut a 1/4" kerf when only the outside blades are used.

Here's a pic to show the proof.

Click on the picture to show it full-sized, and make sure you zoom in to the full size (depending on the browser, just clicking it again may zoom it to full size).

If you look closely, you can see that the Kreg 1/4" block won't *quite* fit in the slot.

Oh, and I've used calipers to measure it also, but this is better for the picture.

I only posted this in a blog post, because I wanted to upload the picture here so I could reference it on the Lumberjocks forum, and I figured if I was going to upload the pic, I might as well add an explanation.
