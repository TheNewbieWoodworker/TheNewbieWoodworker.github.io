title: "I Cut Some Wood! - Powered Up! Day 3.2"
---
Yes, with the help of my wife, I actually cut some wood tonight! 4 pieces of plywood. 4 PIECES! Are you impressed yet?

In case you're following along, I'm writing this post the next day, because I was too tired and bummed out to write it last night. More on that... right now, in fact:

The pieces of plywood I cut are behind the reason I was so bummed out. In case you can't tell, the piece of plywood in front has moisture damage at the bottom.

This is one of those things that's really embarrassing. You know, like when you hear your engine make noise, but hope it'll go away if you ignore it. I knew the place I was storing my wood had some issues. But, out of sight, out of mind. Until now.

So, depending on which time perspective you have, I'm going to bed and leaving this until morning, or, I went to bed last night, and dealt with it today.

In either case, the rest of the story will play out in the next post. Which I may start writing now, we'll see if I have the energy after the day I've had (spoiler alert).

More to come.
