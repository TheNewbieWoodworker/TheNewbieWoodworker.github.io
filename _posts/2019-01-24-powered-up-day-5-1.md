Because of the moisture problem I found in my stack of plywood [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-23-powered-up-day-4-1 %}) (actually, it was the [day before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-22-powered-up-day-3-2 %})):<br/>

I have to build something to keep my plywood (and other wood) off the floor, and this is as far as I got, yesterday:<br/>

## I'm happy to say that I finished today.

### Here's how it went:

I added the front and back fences to the base:<br/>

then attached the base to the frame:<br/>

I cut up some of the leftover tiles we used for the flooring:<br/>

...and added it to the base:<br/>

Then I cut up some 2x4s to act as supports for the sheets of plywood. I'll explain how I did this in an upcoming "Newbie Tool Tip" video.<br/>

And, of course, this was the whole point:<br/>

With everything put back (almost):<br/>

Eventually I'll build one or two big drawers underneath, but (unfortunately) this is how it'll be for now:<br/>

## Tomorrow, back to the project!

I promise. ðŸ˜„
