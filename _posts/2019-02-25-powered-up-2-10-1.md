title: "Stuck - Router Table: Day 10"

I finally got [my video](https://youtu.be/BG-HGjoGvhE){:target="_blank"} out, so back to working on [Steve Ramsey's “Powered Up” online course](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"}. Except I have some issues, and I'm not sure how to progress.

The next step in building the benchtop router table is to cut out the square hole in the "sub top". So I was getting ready to do that, when I discovered a potential problem.

The plywood I used is warped. I knew that, but I didn't really care, because I didn't intend on keeping the table when I was done. Except, both the top and bottom are bowed out. Which means:

1. The table won't sit solidly on the workbench (or whatever you put it on). It'll rock.
2. I'll be attaching the melamine top to the warped "sub-top", which sounds like trouble to me.

So, I'm going to think about it for tonight. I think I'll probably just continue on and hope it works well enough to complete the project. But I've learned from experience to let something like this "marinate" a little before making a final decision.

What do you think I should do?
