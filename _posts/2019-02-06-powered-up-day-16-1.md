To make up for [yesterday's long post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-05-powered-up-day-15-1 %}), this one will be short. Just kidding. Not about this being short, but the reason. The actual reason is I'm trying to get a quick video done. Gotta pay the bills, right? ðŸ˜›

First, I fixed the slight alignment problem I had with the doors. They look pretty good now:

Second, I got the shelves cut:

But not without errors. (For those who already saw this on the Powered Up private Facebook group, please forgive the repetition.)

I think I need Next Level Carpentry's [BS 1000 Board Stretcher](https://youtu.be/bgS6-O2APWY){:target="_blank"}:

Measure twice, cut once doesn't do any good if you have the retention span of Dory from Finding Nemo.

Later.
