title: "Why Change? - Powered Up! Day 10.1"
---
It dawned on me yesterday that I may not have completely explained why I'm changing the plans. There's nothing wrong with the plans for the first project in Steve Ramsey’s [“Powered Up”](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"} online course, but I'm changing them anyway, to fit my needs. Steve has even said that he encourages it.

Here's the reasons:

### 1) Space

I have limited space, so the cabinet needs to be narrower than the original design.

### 2) Old stock

I have some sheets of plywood I want to use up, because they've been sitting in the shop too long, and have become slightly warped. For the future, I've [solved the warping issue]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-23-powered-up-day-4-1 %}), but I still have to use up this wood.

### 3) Dimensions of existing stock (1)

As I've mentioned before, I like to have my 4'x8' sheets of plywood cut in thirds, so I get three 32"x48" sheets. They fit in my SUV, and 32" is normally plenty wide. So I'm limited to 32", probably a little less to make sure the sides are square.

### 4) Dimensions of existing stock (2)

I have 1/2" plywood, but not 1/4" plywood. So for the door fronts, I'm using 1/2" instead of 1/4".

Because of this, I'm just going to butt join the door stiles and rails. When glued to the 1/2" door front, they'll be plenty strong enough. And I've made enough mistakes already. Simple is good, at this point.

Time to get to work. More later.
