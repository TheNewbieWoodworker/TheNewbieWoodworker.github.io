I'll <span style="color:red"><strong>never understand</strong></span> why some people give a YouTube video a "<span style="color:red"><strong>thumbs down</strong></span>" <span style="color:red"><strong>without</strong></span> leaving a comment <span style="color:red"><strong>explaining why</strong></span>.

Don't get me wrong - I knew this was going to happen before I started [my channel](https://youtube.com/c/thenewbiewoodworker). So I don't get depressed about it - it just goes with the territory.

But what purpose does a downvote do without an explanation? It's not like I can learn anything from it.

I know this post won't affect anyone - it probably won't be read by more than a dozen people, if that many. I just need to get this off my chest. But on the off chance you're one of those people who click the thumbs down without leaving a comment:

### Please, for the love of God, leave a comment explaining what you didn't like. Otherwise, you're just being a <span style="color:red"><strong>dick</strong></span>.
