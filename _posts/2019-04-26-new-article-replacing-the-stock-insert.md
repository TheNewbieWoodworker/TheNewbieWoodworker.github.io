I've got a new article up about how I replaced the stock PCS insert plate. It's really just a rehash of [what's in the video](https://youtu.be/GTVLeeUJFHI?t=529){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a [direct link](/sawstop/pcs/insert/stock/replace/).

You can also get there from the [home page](/), by clicking the "SawStop Links" button.

Later.
