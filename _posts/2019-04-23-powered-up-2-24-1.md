Starting up where I left off [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-22-powered-up-2-23-1 %}), I decided to glue on some pieces of pine to help keep the door from cracking again:

{:style="clear: left"}

I added 4 magnets that will end up holding the door in place.

I needed to add magnets to the door wedges so they'd line up with the magnets in the cabinet...

...and I needed to make sure I got the polarity of the magnets right when I glued them in...

...so even before I glued them in, I taped them, so I wouldn't confuse which side of the magnet goes down into the hole.

I glued them all and clamped them down...

...and would you believe it? I got them all correct!

And last but not least, I added the lever clamp:

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow, I'll either work on the top, or the drawers. Maybe both, we'll see.

Later.
