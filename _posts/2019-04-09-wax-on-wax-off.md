Today I tried again to clean some rust and smudges off my SawStop PCS's cast iron table, and put a protective coating on it. It continues to amaze me that I don't seem to be able to exhaust the ways in which I can fail, or at least not totally succeed. But I continue to gain comfort in the knowledge that my failures are the reason I can create videos and articles that help other people avoid those failures.

Here's some pics of some of what I was trying to clean up:

## Cleanup

By the way, I'm using the basic methods SawStop describes in its manual, and also detailed by [Trent Davis](https://www.trentdavis.net/2017/06/13/tool-maintenance-protecting-cast-iron-tabletop/){:target="_blank"}.

I sprayed a liberal dose of WD-40 on the cast iron, and let it sit for 20 or 30 minutes.

Look at how nice and shiny it looks when it's covered in WD-40.

Then I wiped it all off.

Which wasn't what I meant to do next.

I was supposed to clean the top before I wiped it off.

I had run out of WD-40, so I went to Home Depot and bought a big can.

Now I know why they sell it in big cans.

Spray and wait another 20-30 minutes.

This time, instead of wiping it right back off, I scrubbed it clean...

...with this type of cleaning pad.

This is the same spot I showed earlier, but shot from the other side.

Clean, it is. Shiny, it looks.

## GlideCote on, GlideCote off...

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-04-09.1.10.jpg){: .align-left}
Then I ~~used~~ misused GlideCote by spraying on ***way*** too much...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-04-09.1.11.jpg){: .align-left}
...and found it ***really*** hard to wipe off...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-04-09.1.12.jpg){: .align-left}
...let alone get it to look right.

{:style="clear: left"}

## One more time, with feeling...

...and without pictures.

So I decided to stat over again, and removed the GlideCote. I decided I'd rather use regular old Johnson car wax, because I know what to expect from it.

It's going to look great when I'm done. Which will be tomorrow, after I receive my new [WEN 6010 6-Inch Waxer/Polisher](https://amzn.to/2Up0Kni){:target="_blank"}

...to help with the buffing. Because clearly I'm not buff enough to buff clearly.

Later.
