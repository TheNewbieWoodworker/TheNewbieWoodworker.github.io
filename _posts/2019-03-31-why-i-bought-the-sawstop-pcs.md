If you saw my [most recent video](https://youtu.be/OouPywNRZJ8){:target="_blank"}, or you've been following along in this blog, you know I replaced my [SawStop JobSite Saw (JSS)](http://amzn.to/2HkawNh){:target="_blank"} with a [SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw (PCS)](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/sawstop-1-75-hp-professional-cabinet-saw-with-36-professional-t-glide-fence-system-pcs175-tgp236){:target="_blank"}. People have been asking me why I did it. I'll be putting out a video explaining it, but until then, I thought I'd give you an explanation here.

If I don't answer all your questions here, please leave comments below, so I can make sure I explain everything in the video. Thanks.

By the way, if you haven't been following along in this blog, you might want to go back to my [first post on the subject]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-18-sawstop-pcs %}) and read forward, so you can catch up.

## The JobSite Saw is a fine saw

Before I go on, I want you to know that I think the SawStop JobSite Saw is a fine saw, and I recommend it. If you decided to buy it, I don't think you'd be disappointed. Although I recommend you [watch my review](https://youtu.be/3zbYR5ok1V0){:target="_blank"} on the saw before you buy it.

## The main reason I bought the PCS

The main reason I bought the PCS was because I can afford it, thanks to all of you who watch my videos, and buy from my Amazon links. In a way, you all bought it for me.

I don't make a ton of money doing these videos. I certainly don't come close to making enough to quit my day job, if I wasn't already retired. But last year you guys bought me a new computer, and this year you bought me this saw. Thanks, everyone, that was so thoughtful of you! ðŸ˜›

So like I said, I bought it because I could. (And I figured out how to fit it in my workshop, but I'll explain that in the video.)

## The reasons I almost didn't buy it

I'll quote from [another blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-19-sawstop-pcs-pt2 %}), where I thought I had decided not to buy it:

>There's a lot of reasons, one of them being I don't want to deal with a 4" dust collection port.
>
>But the bigger picture is that **I don't want a lot of high end equipment in my shop**. That's not an image I want to project in my YouTube videos. You don't need high end equipment, and I don't want people to think they do.
>
>You might say "But you've got a SawStop already, and people think of that as high end". The biggest reason they know it's a SawStop is because the fence says "SawStop" on it. I know the table top says it also, but it's not as obvious. So what am I going to do about the fence?
>
>**I'm going to build a new fence**

## So what changed my mind?

First of all, I talked with some people who own a PCS and use a shop-vac-based 2 1/2" dust collection system, and they said it was adequate. Let's not let this devolve into a fight over dust collection systems, though, OK?

But the biggest reason is I discovered that my plan for building a new fence wouldn't work. I hadn't taken into account the sliding rail and clamp that allow you to open the extension. My fence plan just wouldn't work with those.

## And the SawStop freebie deal, too...

This month, SawStop had a deal where if you bought the PCS, you could get a free mobile base, or free overarm dust collection system. I got the mobile base, worth $250. So that was the incentive for buying it now.

## So I need your help

I want to cover up the top of the fence that says "SawStop":

I want to put a message of some kind on the fence that lets people know "you don't need high end equipment". But I can't use a lot of words, because you won't be able to read it.

Here's one idea, but it's not clever, and I'm not thrilled with it:

Of course, I'd like my logo on it also, so that makes the text smaller:

But surely you guys can come up with something better? I hope so. Leave it in the comments below, or in the comments for my [SawStop Accident video](https://youtu.be/OouPywNRZJ8){:target="_blank"}.

Thanks!
