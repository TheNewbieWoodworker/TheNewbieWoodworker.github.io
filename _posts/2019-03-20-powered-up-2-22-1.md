I'm working on another video, so I haven't done a *lot* of work on the router table, but I actually *have* done *something*.

As you may remember, the door facade will be held in by blocks with magnets, that squeeze into the corners of the opening, like this:

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-20.1.01.jpg){: .image-border}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-20.1.02.jpg){: .align-left}
So I clamped the door facade to the front of the lift, positioned so the lever can move up and down in the slot freely.

Then I unscrewed the lift so I could drop it down out of the way...

...so I could reach inside with a pencil and draw an outline around the opening.

I used some double-sided tape to position the four blocks, so I could make sure they're in the right spot.

I have to remember not to use this type of double-sided tape anymore, because it's too hard to remove.

Eventually I got them in the right place.

I put threaded inserts in the door, and drilled oversized counterbored holes in the blocks, so I could use machine screws and washers to attach the blocks.

This allows me to reposition them until I get a Goldilocks fit.

Like this.

## Next Up:

Next step is to add the magnets, finish the lift door, make the lever, and build the drawer.

Later.
