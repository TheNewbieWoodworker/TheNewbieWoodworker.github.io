Every once in a while I get a comment on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/thenewbiewoodworker){:target="_blank"} asking how I made the cabinets in my garage.

In the past, I've always laughed and replied that we had them built for us, and I couldn't imagine building them myself.

Well, now that I'm in the middle of Steve Ramsey’s [“Powered Up”](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"} online course, I don't look at the cabinets in the same way.

I'm still not sure I could make them now, at least not and do as good a job, but I no longer look at them and think they're outside my potential. I understand pretty-much how they were made. And if I didn't have them already, I would be thinking about how to build them, and be excited about the possibility.

This is a benefit of taking the course that's hard to quantify. Intangible, if you will. But it *might* just be the single most important thing I'll get out of the course. The belief that maybe I can make things I never dreamed of making before.

Is that worth $200? Absolutely! Can you put a price on dreams?

Later.
