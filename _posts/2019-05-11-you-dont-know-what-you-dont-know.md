One of my favorite statements is *"You don't know what you don't know."* It's so true, and yet we forget it every day. Here's an example, based on a real life event that happened to me yesterday.

This occurred in the [SawStop Users' Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sawstopusersgroup/){:target="_blank"}. [^1] &nbsp;***This is not verbatim***, because I already deleted the original post and frankly, I don't remember the exact words, but it's close enough to make the point.

Make sure you read the whole story, because it's not how it appears at first glance.

## The Post

Imagine you're scrolling through the forum, and you come across the following post:

> I just bought a shiny new table saw, with a beautiful cast iron top. I just noticed some scratches, and I don't want to mar the pretty top. What can I do to keep the table saw looking like new?

So you reply with something like this:

> If you think your saw looks scratched, you'd hate to see mine! [^7]

Or:

> It's not a museum piece, just use your saw and quit complaining!

Or:

> If you wanted a mirror, you should have just bought a mirror. The saw was made to be used, not admired!

Those seem like reasonable responses, considering the question, right? I mean, they're not exactly nice, but they're pretty benign.

## Except, that wasn't the actual original post

Here's the ***actual*** original post: [^2]

> I just noticed some scratches on the cast iron top of my new table saw. I have no idea where they came from. What's the best way to handle this? Should I try to buff them out, or just wax over them?

### What you thought you knew:

You thought I was afraid to mar my pretty-looking new saw. In other words, you read it as if I had made the [first post I talked about](#the-post).

### What you didn't know: [^3]

I've never had a cast iron table before. I have no idea what to expect. When I first got the saw, lots of people were quick to warn me about how quickly it can rust. So naturally, I want to make sure not to do anything that could permanently damage the cast iron.

So I asked about the scratches, and what I should do about them.

## A Better Response?

#### <span style="color:blue">Always answer the question that was asked.</span>

If you want to [ridicule the poster afterwords](/assets/images-posts/2019-05-11.1.01.jpg){:target="_blank"}, that's up to you [^4] [^5] but always answer the question first.

In other words, assuming these are things you believe:

> Don't worry about the scratches, you'll get plenty more over time. Just use the saw like the tool it actually is, and don't worry about trying to keep it brand-new-looking.

Or, if you're Trent Davis, who actually knows what he's talking about, you might respond something like this (and again, this is a paraphrase because I don't remember the actual words):

> You should probably clean it like I talk about in [my web article](https://www.trentdavis.net/2017/06/13/tool-maintenance-protecting-cast-iron-tabletop/){:target="_blank"}, just to take the edge off the scratches, and wax it.

## In Closing

Remember, <span style="color:blue">***you don't know what you don't know***</span>.

When you attribute motivation to someone's post without actually knowing the facts, you run the risk of:

1. Posting a useless reply.
2. Coming off sounding like a troll.
3. Hurting someone's feelings, who only wanted an honest answer to an honest question. [^6]

    **But most importantly:**

4. You run the risk of making the group no longer a safe place to ask questions.

## "Are you talking to me?"

If you think I wrote this blog post as a specific response to something you said on the forum, and you're bristling with the need to defend yourself or even fight back, then I have just one thing to say:

My job here is done.

[^1]: I really like the SawStop Users' Group on Facebook, by the way. This is an anomaly. Well, actually, that's not true. This is the *second* time something like this has happened to me on the forum. The first time was when I asked a different question about caring for the cast iron top. But regardless, I still like the group, and in fact that's why I'm posting this in the first place, so it'll continue to be a good place to hang out.

[^2]: Paraphrased because I don't remember the exact wording, but this is the gist.

[^3]: Or maybe you knew, but didn't care, in which case, you might as well quit reading, because you're not going to agree with my point.

[^4]: Yes, "[ridicule](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ridicule){:target="_blank"}" is the correct term.

[^5]: Obviously I'd recommend *against* ridiculing someone, but even *I* have trouble holding back sometimes. Still, taking the high road is preferable. ðŸ™„

[^6]: You didn't hurt *my* feelings. Unless you consider being pissed off because you didn't bother to answer the question the same as hurt feelings. ðŸ¤¬

[^7]: *EDIT 13:43 PDT:* I was just reminded that after the person left this reply, he left another with an explanation of why I shouldn't be too worried. So in retrospect, I shouldn't have included this reply. But regardless, the points that follow are still valid.
