I make an effort to reply to all comments people leave on my YouTube videos. YouTube doesn't always do a great job of notifying us creators when we receive comments, especially replies to old comments. <span style="color:blue">**So I wrote some custom software to help solve the problem.**</span>

You might not think that the details of this software matter to you, and maybe they won't, but they'll help explain why I sometimes reply the way I do:

* **My code reads all the comments/replies to all the videos on my YouTube channel.**

* **Then it shows me comments or replies I haven't read yet.**

* **How does it know what I've read and what I haven't? <span style="color:blue">It's based on whether I've replied or not.[^1]</span>**

So if there's a comment with no replies, or there are replies under a comment and the last reply isn't from me, then it assumes I haven't read it yet.

Which means in order to tell the software I've read something, <span style="color:blue">**I *have to* reply to it**</span>.

And this is all well and good, except sometimes, it doesn't make sense to leave a reply. For example:

> **Viewer:** Did you know you can do that with a band saw?
>
>> **Me:** No I didn't. Thanks for the cool tip! üòÑ
>
>> **Viewer:** You're welcome.

Or how about this:

> **Viewer 1:** Does anyone know where to buy this product in Australia?
>
>> **Viewer 2:** I found it at Bunnings.

In either case, it doesn't make sense (in the context of the discussion) for me to leave a reply. So I usually reply with a thumbs up:

>> üëç

I know it might seem a little strange when you read it, but that's why I do it.

I'll bet you're glad you asked, right? üò≥

Later.

[^1]: Well, I actually have a way to "mark" a comment or reply as "read", but it requires storing data locally in the browser, and there's a limited amount of storage available, so I try not to use it much.
