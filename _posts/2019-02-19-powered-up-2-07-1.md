I've always had a love affair with Baltic Birch plywood. Even before I knew what to call it, I'd see a picture of something made from it, with the end grain showing, and I just wanted to touch it. Stroke my hand along its smooth edges. \*ahem\*

When I started doing serious woodworking a couple of years ago, I watched a YouTube video (don't remember which one) that put a name to the object of my desire: Baltic Birch plywood. I knew she was an expensive mistress.

***WTH am I doing here?*** Pretend I didn't say that.

I knew that Baltic Birch plywood was expensive. But I also knew that I had enough problems with lack of skill, and that if I could use material of consistently high quality, it would help cut down on the variables.

And since then, if I built something out of plywood, it was out of Baltic Birch plywood.

Here's a ***small sampling***:

### Then I started Powered Up

For the first project in [Steve Ramsey's “Powered Up” online course](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"}, the shop cabinet, I used pine plywood. It was actually pretty decent pine plywood, and it worked pretty well. See [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-08-powered-up-1-18-1 %}){:target="_blank"} for pics.

I decided I wouldn't mind using it again.

For the current project, I couldn't find that pine plywood anywhere. I'm wondering if it has to do with bad weather stalling shipments, or something like that. Anyway, read [yesterday's post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-18-powered-up-2-06-2 %}){:target="_blank"} for details of what I ended up with.

### Reasons to love Baltic Birch plywood

Now I have even more reasons.

The plywood I'm using now splintered when I cut it cross grain, *even though I used painters tape*.

I *never* had to worry about this with Baltic Birch plywood.

### Still in love

So, although the pine plywood wasn't too bad, and if I can find some more, I wouldn't mind using it...

***Nothing compares to my first great love.***

Later.
