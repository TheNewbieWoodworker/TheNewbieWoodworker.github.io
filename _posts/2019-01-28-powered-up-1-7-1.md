Sorry I haven't posted in a couple of days. I had a video to get out. And I feel another video coming on...

One of the reasons it takes me a long time to do some things, is that my mind is always trying to come up with different, and hopefully better ways to do them. Case in point:

In [my last post](({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-25-powered-up-1-6-2 %})) I talked about possibly using my box joint jig, but it turns out it won't work with stock this wide. So I'm stuck with using the half-laps.

So I'm getting ready to do my glue-up, and I don't have enough clamps of the required size. I *could* go to Harbor Freight and get more clamps, but even at a cheap $8 per clamp, I need 8 more of them, so that's a lot of money. Not to mention that I don't want to figure out where to store them.

So here's where my clamping brainstorming comes in, and here's the progression:

## Corner Clamps

My [corner clamps](https://youtu.be/X4BSyZuc-ak){:target="_blank"} aren't really for compressing parts together like you do when gluing. But they really help in getting everything aligned, and keeping them that way.

## Bar Clamps

Here's the bar clamps, and as I said, I only have 4 this size.

## Bessey Strap Clamp

I have one of these Bessey Strap Clamps, but it's not nearly long enough. However, that led me to:

## HF Ratcheting Tie Down Straps

I have a couple of these Harbor Freight ratcheting tie-down strap thingies, which ***are*** long enough. So the question is, how best to use them to clamp the cabinet?

## Using the Bessey Strap Clips

Turns out the Bessey strap clips fit on the HF straps, so this looks like a good option. Except, of course, that I'll have to loosen the strap to apply the glue, and then I'll have to re-position the clips again afterwards.

## Custom Strap Clips

So I made these wooden clips, and I'm using double-sided tape to stick them in place. I think this is going to make it easy to get the straps back on, after applying the glue.

## A Little Bit of Everything

So I'm going to try all three clamping options, plus I'll still use my corner clamps to hold everything in place. Wish me luck!

More later.

### Addendum

I posted a YouTube video about all this. Check it out:
