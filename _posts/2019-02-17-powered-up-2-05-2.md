If you've been [following me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thenewbiewoodworker/){:target="_blank"}, or you've been reading some of my posts in Steve's private Facebook group, then this post may be redundant. But I've been spending the day with friends, taking a trip to Rockler, messing with my blog page navigation buttons, and doing other generally boring stuff, so this is all I've got for today.

But tomorrow I get wood, and that's when the fun starts. ðŸ˜³

Since I modified Steve's router table plans to [accommodate my router lift]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-13-powered-up-2-01-1 %}), I also had to change the cutlist. Normally that would be a real PITA.

But I found a fantastic free website called [CutList Optimizer](http://cutlistoptimizer.com/){:target="_blank"} that makes it a ***lot*** easier.

#### Here's what I said about it on Instagram:

>I just found this website, and I love it. If you ever have to lay out cut sheets, you need to try this. I'm a retired developer, so I can appreciate great programming. And this site rocks!
>
>The customization options are awesome, including things like:
>
>1. Considering grain direction on some or all (or no) pieces,
>2. Kerf width,
>3. Optimize for Least Waste or Least # of Cuts,
>4. List of cuts and in what order... I could go on. Am I gushing? YES. I love this site!
>
>NOTE: I haven't actually done a cut based on this site, so it's always possible it's wrong. But I doubt it.

#### Highly recommended.

And finally, this is what happens when you don't clean or replace your air filters often enough:

I'll let you guess which one is the old one, and which one is the new one.

Later.
