It seems everyone and their brother are recommending this blade, so I thought I'd give it a try.

At [$155 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2MQgEng){:target="_blank"}, I sure hope it's worth it. Time will tell.

One thing I can vouch for, though, is <span style="color:blue">**the teeth are really f'ing sharp**</span>! I got cut just by *looking* at the teeth!

OK, not really, but I got the gloves out really quickly after that.

No, these are not blood-coated teeth, although I wouldn't blame you if you thought they were. I have my red Freud blade behind the new Forrest blade, and the Forrest blade is *just* a little smaller in diameter.

Since my table saw is a [SawStop PCS](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/sawstop-1-75-hp-professional-cabinet-saw-with-36-professional-t-glide-fence-system-pcs175-tgp236){:target="_blank"}, and has a brake cartridge, I needed to check the gap between the blade and the brake to make sure it's between 1/16th and 1/8th of an inch.

SawStop makes it easy to check the gap, with this yellow plastic thingy. The tip (near my bandaged finger) is basically the right size for the gap.

So you stick the tip between the blade and the brake, and check the gap.

If the gap isn't right, you adjust it by turning this yellow nut thingy, using something that looks like a hex key but actually has a rounded end (that's still hex-shaped).

The cool thing is, the hex key fits in the yellow triangle thingy, and it sticks to the side of the cabinet saw with magnets.

I also verified that the blade (yellow arrow) and the riving knife (red arrow) were aligned, which they were.

For a quick test of the blade, I cut some plywood cross-grain to see how much tear-out I got, if any.

By the way, the read-and-white insert plate here is from [Infinity Tools](https://www.infinitytools.com/saw-blades-accessories/table-saw/table-saw-zero-clearance-inserts){:target="_blank"}, and I'll talk about it in an upcoming blog post.

It's kind of hard to see the result here (below), but click on the image then zoom it in to actual size, and hopefully you can see just how perfect the cut is, with absolutely no tear-out.
