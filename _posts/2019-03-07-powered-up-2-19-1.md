I spent yesterday playing around with the [Freud Tongue & Groove Router Bit set](https://amzn.to/2NKgpai){:target="_blank"}, making sure I understood how it worked. Today I used it for real, and I have to say, the results were pretty darn good for the first time.

<style>
  h2 {
    margin-top: 1em !important;
  }
</style>

> FYI, I'll be abbreviating "tongue and groove" as **<span style="color:blue">T&G</span>**.

This is the router bit set - follow along with the bouncing balls:

**A:** Groove-cutting bit.<br/>
**B:** Tongue-cutting bit.

<span style="color:green">**1:** Each bit has two blades.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**2:** Each has a bearing. *Above* the blades for the groove bit, *in between* the blades for the tongue bit.</span>

<span style="background-color:yellow">**3:** Each has a set of shims which are stored on the top; move them to between the blades to change the widths.</span>

<span style="color:red">**4:** Remove the nuts to move the shims.</span>

## Freud Router Bit Packaging Tip

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.02.jpg){: .align-left}

If you've ever bought a Freud router bit, you've probably struggled to remove the bit without slicing your fingers.

There's a hole in the bottom (red arrows) that you can stick something in, and push the bit out. I usually use a hex key.

The T&G set has these holes also, but I drilled out the holes so the shanks don't fit quite so tight. I drilled too far in one of them (yellow arrow).

## Finding the base widths

I wanted to know what size tongue and groove the bits cut, without shims. That'll make it easy to know what shims to add, to achieve a specific dimension.

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.03.jpg){: .align-left}
So I aligned the fence with the bearing on the groove-cutting bit (this bit has the bearing *above* the blades)...

{:style="clear: left"}

...then cut and measured the dado.

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.05.jpg){: .align-left}
I did the same with the tongue-cutting bit (this bit has the bearing *between* the blades)...

...then cut and measured the tongue.

## Setting Up to Cut the Grooves

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.07.jpg){: .align-left}
I measured the panel that will go in the grooves...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.08.jpg){: .align-left}
...did some math...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.09.jpg){: .align-left}
...gathered the shims necessary to get the width I needed...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.10.jpg){: .align-left}
...made a few test cuts...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.11.jpg){: .align-left}
...until I got a Goldilocks fit, and as close to the center of the stock as I could get.

## Preparing the Stock Pieces

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.12.jpg){: .align-left}
I put blue painters tape on one side of each stock piece.

You can't really get the tongues and grooves perfectly centered, so I'll make sure I cut every piece with the blue tape facing up. That way, all the cuts will be off-center to the same side.

If I forget and put the taped side down, the piece drags and doesn't slide very easily, making me stop and pay attention. This actually happened once. Thanks to [Colin Knecht for this tip](https://youtu.be/i2lYHvjHG_E){:target="_blank"}.

## Cutting the Grooves

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.13.jpg){: .align-left}
I cut the grooves in all the rails and stiles.

## Setting Up and Cutting the Tongues

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.14.jpg){: .align-left}
I did the same kinds of calculations for the tongues, so I knew how many shims to add...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.15.jpg){: .align-left}
...and did some test cuts until I got it right...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.16.jpg){: .align-left}
Then I used a DIY miter gauge and a backing board (to prevent tear-out) to cut all the tongues.

## Some Assembly Required

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.17.jpg){: .align-left}
All that was left was to assemble the pieces...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-07.1.18.jpg){: .align-left}
...including the panels.

{:style="clear: left"}

I haven't glued anything up yet. Here's the joints, which are pretty darn close to perfect. A little sanding will take them the rest of the way there.

## Why So Much Detail?

I know I went into more detail here than normal, but I'm planning out my video, and this helped.

Later.
