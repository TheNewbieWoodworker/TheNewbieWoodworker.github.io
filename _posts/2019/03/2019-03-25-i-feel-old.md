I'm 62 years old, but normally I don't feel old at all. Oh, some grunting when I get up out of a chair, a few aches and pains, but I just don't normally feel like I'm 62. Until today.

[Yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019/03/2019-03-24-sawstop-pcs-pt1 %}) I got my SawStop PCS, and started assembly. Today I did more, and got this far:

I'm pretty close to done, actually. But I'm so frickin' tired, I started making mistakes, so it's time to stop, even though I can see the finish line.

All the getting down on the ground, getting back up, bending at odd angles, along with the PITA that is the process of aligning the extension wings and extension table to the saw top...

...and I'm just plumb exhausted. And certainly too tired to blog about what I did today.

So I'll finish up tomorrow, including cutting up all the cardboard and styrofoam and throwing it away.

Later.
