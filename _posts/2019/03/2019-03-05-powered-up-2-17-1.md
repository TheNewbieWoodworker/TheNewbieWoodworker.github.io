Still having issues cutting consistent tongue and groove joints. The problem is mostly equipment related, with a spattering of periodic stupidity. I'm not in the mood to talk about the equipment issues right now, and I'm sure you're tired of reading about my stupidity.

I ordered a tongue and groove router bit set which should be here this evening, and I'll give that a try tomorrow.

Later.
