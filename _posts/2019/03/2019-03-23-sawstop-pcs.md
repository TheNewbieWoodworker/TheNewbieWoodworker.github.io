I bought the 1.75hp SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw with the 36" top and T-Glide fence from the Woodcraft store in Fountain Valley, CA. The store's run by a really nice couple - the kind of people I'd love to get to know. Too bad the store is so far away, relatively speaking. If you're in the neighborhood, drop in and say Hi.
