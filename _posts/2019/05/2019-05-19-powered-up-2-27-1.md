My video review of [Steve Ramsey's ‚ÄúPowered Up‚Äù online course](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"} is live.

I'm terrified of the possible responses, but I don't *think* anyone knows where I live. üôÇ I only say that because I didn't whitewash my review, and I have strong opinions. I mean, all-in-all, it's a positive review. But still...

This is my first video using the [new camera and teleprompter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019/05/2019-05-08-teleprompter-video-audio-setup-v0.1 %}). I think I did a decent job with the teleprompter, although I've got some work to do. I've also got an issue with the lights occasionally reflecting off my glasses. Not sure what to do about that yet.

It's also the first video I've shot in 4k, although I rendered it in 1080p. It's a little scary to see your face in 4k, let me tell you. But the colors are better and the picture is much sharper, even downconverted to 1080p.  I did a little color grading to cool the picture just a little, and I think it looks about as good as I'm going to get, without a lot more learning. It'll be interesting to see if I still feel this way in a year.

If you feel like it, let me know what you think.

Later.
