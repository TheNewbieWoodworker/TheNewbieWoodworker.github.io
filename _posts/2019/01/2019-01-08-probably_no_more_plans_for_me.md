title: "Probably no more Plans from me..."
---
Last October, I released my [Corner Clamp](https://youtu.be/X4BSyZuc-ak) video, which includes plans that can be purchased for $5. And then 5 days ago, I released my [Lever-Operated Router Lift](https://youtu.be/LJqPDADi8MM) video, again with $5 plans.

To say the plan sales have been underwhelming would be an understatement. Considering how much time and effort they took, the ROI just isn't worth it. I'm figuring I'm getting about $1 per hour of work I spent on the plans, which would be fine if the plans didn't take me a *really long* time to create.

If anyone has any thoughts on the subject, please feel free to leave a comment or send me an email.

Not that anyone reads these posts, but that's my fault for not posting very often. So if nobody reads them, why am I still ~~talking~~ writing? I must like the sound of my own ~~voice~~ typing. ðŸ˜›
