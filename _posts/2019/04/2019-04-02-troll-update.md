title: "Troll Update"

In [yesterday's post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019/04/2019-04-01-quick-update %}), I mentioned I was having fun with a troll, and suggested you might want to join in on the fun.

Unfortunately, he ran out of troll fuel, and resorted to cussing. Personally, I'm not offended by cussing. I dabble in it myself from time to time. 😏 But I don't want it in my channel comments. I told him to not cus on my channel. He responded by cussing at me. So I banned his ass. 😛

I'm actually kind of sad I had to ban him, because now I can't play with him anymore. He was so perfectly clueless as to how much of a fool he was making of himself.

And I was all prepared to pull a ***James Veitch*** on him...

...and ***really*** start to have fun.

Later.
