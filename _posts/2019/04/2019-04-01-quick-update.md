title: "Quick Update, and a Troll Sighting"

It's been a busy day. I uploaded a quick tip video, then I received some comments that made me realize I didn't explain it very well. So I uploaded an updated video, in which I managed to... well, you can [watch the video](https://youtu.be/uK-GRSDt8RM){:target="_blank"}.

At about the same time, my Craftsman shop vac died. I don't have time to mess around with it, so I went to Home Depot and bought something to replace it. As of right now, I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, because of the video and this blog post.

~~As an aside, if you've ever wondered what a troll looks like, check out this comment thread from my SawStop accident video. I'm just too nice. I'll let one of you take him to task, if you want.~~

See my [Troll Update blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019/04/2019-04-02-troll-update %}) for the latest on the troll.

Later.
