I'm getting near the end of my second project in Steve Ramsey’s [“Powered Up”](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"} online course. Actually, it's Steve's third project, but it's the second one I've done.

I started blogging regularly so I could talk about my progress, and the lessons I've learned. I figured that if I was going to take notes, I might as well post them to a blog.

It's evolved over time, becoming not only about Powered Up, but general blog-worthy subjects also.

## It's time to re-assess my goals.

Once I'm done with this current Powered Up project, I need to decide what I'm going to do in the future, with this blog.

I enjoy blogging, and I'll probably continue no matter what. The question is, how often will I blog.

## The Poll

So, to gather information about how much of an impact my blog is having, I'm conduction a poll. It'll probably be open for a few days, possibly through the weekend depending on the response.
