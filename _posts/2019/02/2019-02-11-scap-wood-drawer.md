So I'm trying to finish up my lumber cubbyhole, specifically the scrap wood drawer.

I'm close, but there's an issue with the legs that support the lumber rack, and the drawer won't roll all the way back...

...so I have to remove all the lumber and fix it, which is going to have to wait until tomorrow.

Whenever I try to remove the tall lumber in the back, everything in the front falls over. So I added a rail, kind of like in an amusement park ride:

It's held on with bungee cords, and it'll lean forward, but won't let the lumber fall out.

Anyway, I'll finish up tomorrow, and work on Powered Up stuff.

Later.
