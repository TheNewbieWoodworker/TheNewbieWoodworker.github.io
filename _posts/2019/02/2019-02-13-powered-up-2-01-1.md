title: "Need a Lift? Router Table: Day 1"

I'm starting what is actually the third project in [Steve Ramsey's “Powered Up” online course](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/powered-up){:target="_blank"}, the Benchtop Router Table. And of course I can't ever do anything the way the plans say.

<style>
  .su_img {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    background-color: white;
  }
</style>

![](/assets/images-posts/2019/02/2019-02-13.1.01.jpg){: .align-left}

I'm going to modify the router table so I can (hopefully) fit my [Lever-Operated Router Lift](https://youtu.be/LJqPDADi8MM){:target="_blank"} in it.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019/02/2019-02-13.1.02.jpg){: .align-left .su_img}

I'll have to change the height, which is no problem...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019/02/2019-02-14.1.03b.jpg){: .align-left .su_img}

...but figuring out what to do with the lever...

{:style="clear: left"}

...and the doors *is* problematic.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019/02/2019-02-14.1.05.jpg){: .align-left .su_img}

I *could* just make the doors narrower, but there's all sorts of problems with that.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019/02/2019-02-14.1.06.jpg){: .align-left .su_img}

So I think I'll just make the front *look* like doors, but in reality it'll be held on by magnets.

I'm a little concerned about dust collection, so I ***might*** add my "dust drawer", but Im not sure how I'd attach the hose, because there's not a lot of room in the back, between the back of the lift housing, and the router table cabinet back.

{:style="clear: left"}

Or, since I'm not going to use this table when I'm done, maybe I just won't worry about dust collection.

Which begs the question:

#### What should I do with this project when I finish it?

[Edit 15:06 PT: Whatever I do with the table, I'll include the router lift.]

Later.
