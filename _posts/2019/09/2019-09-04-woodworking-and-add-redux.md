This post is about how my <span style="color:blue">**ADD affects my woodworking**</span>. I've mentioned this subject before, and in fact some of this text is from a previous post. But I'm going to be expanding on this in the near future, so I thought I'd talk about it again. If you find this information useful, please [share](#Share) this post.

## Can you take a moment to consider the possibility?

I run into all sorts of reactions when I try to explain what it's like to live with ADD. Many people are open to learning about it.

But a lot of peopler think "<span style="color:blue"><b>everyone has that</b></span>", and if you just "<span style="color:blue">**stay focused**</span>", or "<span style="color:blue">**try harder**</span>", then it won't be an issue.

If that's you, <span style="color:blue">**I'd like to challenge you**</span> to imagine, for the next few minutes, that <span style="color:blue">**maybe not everyone is the same**</span>.

## ADD, ADHD, WTF?

"**ADD**" is "Attention Deficit Disorder", more commonly called "ADHD" these days, where the "H" stands for "Hyperactivity". <span style="color:blue">**I always leave the "H" out**</span>, because, if anything, mine is "Attention Deficit ***Inactivity*** Disorder", due to the <span style="color:blue">**amount of time I spend sitting on my ass**</span>.

What ADD means in my case is that it's <span style="color:blue">**hard for me to keep my attention on one thing**</span>, hence the name "Attention ***Deficit***". I'm extremely easily distracted. But more than that - there are times when <span style="color:blue">**no matter how hard I try**</span>, I can't stay focused on something important. <span style="color:red">**Like a sharp blade**</span>, for instance.

## A Matter of Degree

For those of you who think "<span style="color:blue">**everyone has that**</span>", you may be right. But the question is, ***how much*** do you have it? <span style="color:blue">**How much does it affect your daily life?**</span>

<span style="color:magenta">**Think of it like eyesight.**</span> Some people have **20/20 vision** or better. Some people **only need glasses to read**, but they could probably get by without them if they had to. Others are <span style="color:blue">**virtually blind**</span> without their glasses.

When it goes from the "<span style="color:blue">**I can squint and still read**</span>" stage to the "<span style="color:blue">**I'm blind without my glasses**</span>" stage, <span style="color:red">**that's when it becomes a "Disorder"**</span>.

## You Might Have ADD If...

In my best "You might be a redneck" voice, <span style="color:blue">**You might have ADD...**</span>

* If your teachers always wrote on your report card "Dan <span style="color:blue">**needs to focus more in class**</span>". And if your name isn't "Dan", you've got other problems.

* When you're talking to someone, and they keep wondering <span style="color:blue">**what you're looking at over their shoulder**</span>.

* When people are constantly asking "<span style="color:blue">**Did you hear what I just said?**</span>" If you're male, this doesn't count for your spouse, because everyone knows we men don't listen to our wives very well.

* <span style="color:blue">**If you've tried to pray or meditate**</span>, only to give up because <span style="color:blue">**your mind won't stop long enough to focus**</span>.

* If you're always saying "<span style="color:blue">**Now what was I just doing?**</span>" This doesn't count if you're over 50, because this is actually how you know you're over 50. ðŸ˜‚

And finally, <span style="color:blue">**relevant to woodworking**</span>:

* If you're <span style="color:blue">**constantly cutting the wrong side of something**</span>, or the wrong direction, or even the wrong piece, because your mind is on something else. **Note the "constantly" part**, because everyone does this from time to time.

* If you've <span style="color:blue">**stuck your hand in the blade**</span> when it was *almost*, but *not quite* done spinning down, and you've <span style="color:blue">**done it more than once**</span>... (guilty).

I'm sure there's other examples, and I welcome them in the comments, below.

## So...

I'm planning on delving more into the subject of ADD and Woodworking in the future, including an upcoming video. I especially want to focus on ways to help prevent mistakes and accidents, for people with ADD.

Assuming I don't get too distracted by something else, of course. ðŸ™„

So let me know what you think in the comments, below. And share this post, if you think it might help someone else.
