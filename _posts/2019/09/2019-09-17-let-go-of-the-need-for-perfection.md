A quick post to talk about what I've been working on, what I'm going to be working on, and perfectionism.

I mentioned in [my previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019/09/2019-09-04-woodworking-and-add-redux %}) about ADD that I wanted to work on a video about ADD and Woodworking. I said <span style="color:blue">"Assuming I don't get too distracted by something else, of course."</span> Guess what? I *did* get distracted by something else - something that I really didn't need to spend time on. But I did it anyway. \*sigh\*, the story of my life.

Check out this link to see the documentation for the project I created that distracted me. The documentation probably won't mean anything to you, but just scroll down to see *how much effor*t I put into the documentation, which should give you some idea of how much work went into the project. [http://bit.ly/2lTMXF7](http://bit.ly/2lTMXF7){:target="_blank"} And I doubt more than 100 people will use it, in the next 5 years.

Yep, I'm incapable of doing anything half-assed. Although with this upcoming video on ADD and Woodworking, I'm going to strive for "good enough" instead of trying for "perfect", which can't really be achieved anyway.

And to prove my point, how many of you noticed the spelling error in one of the above images? Probably all of you, because I think the font I used made you have to focus on reading it carefully, thus defeating the purpose of the image in the first place. But you know what? Too bad. I'm leaving it that way. Good for me.

Of course, I just *had* to comment that I know it wasn't perfect, didn't I? And I probably spent more time on this explanation than it would have taken to fix it.

Wish me luck. I'm going to ned it.
