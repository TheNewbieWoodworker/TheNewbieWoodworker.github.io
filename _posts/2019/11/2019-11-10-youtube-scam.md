I received the above email last night that *almost* looks official, but after looking at it closer, it's obviously a phishing attack.

The "Sender" obviously isn't a true YouTube email address. And the link goes somewhere I don't even want to decipher.

So if you're a YouTuber, or know someone who is, pass this warning along.

Later.
