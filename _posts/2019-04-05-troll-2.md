I received a comment on my [SawStop Saved My Thumb](https://youtu.be/OouPywNRZJ8){:target="_blank"} video, and I'm trying to come up with a good response. <span style="color:red">**I'm hoping some of you might have some suggestions**</span>. And just so you know, contrary to what you might think, these comments don't bother me. I usually come up with pretty good responses. But this one has me a little stumped.

Here's the comment:

> If you are that careless, maybe it is time to sell your tools.ï»¿

He's not the first to say this, by the way.

### He may not be wrong!

I've [thought about this before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-12-woodworking-and-add %}). <span style="color:red">**But let's assume he's wrong**</span>. ðŸ˜„

### My Goal

My goal with these kinds of comments is to <span style="color:red">**treat people with respect**</span>, and hope I can make them realize the world's not so black and white.

I know <span style="color:red">**a lot of you**</span>, perhaps most of you, <span style="color:red">**would tell me to ignore him**</span> because there's no chance of getting through to him.

<span style="color:red">**But I disagree**</span>. I've had success with at least one other person, so I'm willing to keep trying.

#### Think of this as a science experiment, if nothing else.

## What NOT to say

> Mistakes happen. Ask your parents.

Yes, I think things like that, but they won't help. Although, if you've got funny responses, I don't mind reading them, even if I won't post them.

Probably.
