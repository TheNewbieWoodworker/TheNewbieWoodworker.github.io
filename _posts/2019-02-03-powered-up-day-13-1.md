In [yesterday evening's post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-02-powered-up-day-12-2 %}) I went on a rant. I still think my points were valid. **But I think I know why I had some of the issues I had.**

I'm using 3/4" Baltic Birch plywood, which is actually .7" thick. Steve's plans call for 1" pine boards, which are actually 3/4" thick. (Don't you just love "nominal" dimensions?) That means that my boards are a combined .1" thinner than Steve's.

So that's probably a large part of my problem.

But I still stand by yesterday's post, at least, the main point of yesterday's post: We need more explanation, and we need him answering questions on the forum.

Later.
