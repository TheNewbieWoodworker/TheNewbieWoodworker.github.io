I want to say thank you to everyone who voted in [the poll]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-24-blogging-poll %}). It was a tie.

But honestly, I had already made my decision - I just wanted to hear what you guys thought.

I'm going to finish up the Powered Up project (after I finish the video I'm working on right now), then I'm going to cut down on my blogging. I won't stop, but it will be much less often.

I want to put most of my energy towards videos, and between the Powered Up projects and the blogging, it just spread me too thin.

I'm not sure what I'll do about Instagram. I think I'll try and start using it like most people do, by posting pics of what I'm working on. That doesn't take much time, and all I really have to do is remember to do it.

So that's it for now. Thanks again, everyone!
