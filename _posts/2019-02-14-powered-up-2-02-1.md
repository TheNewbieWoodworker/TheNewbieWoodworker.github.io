I started building the [router lift](https://youtu.be/LJqPDADi8MM){:target="_blank"} today.

Always check for a square blade.

I needed to cut a couple of dados for my miter tracks, so I used the technique from my [Perfect Dados, No Jigs Required!](https://youtu.be/geHBzciuv_A){:target="_blank"} video, and cut a spacer...

...which I cut in two, and placed between my fence and my sacrificial fence, and cut one side of the dados...

...then I removed the spacers and cut the other side of the dados.

And then cut out everything in between.

After installing the miter tracks in the dados, I used my [DIY Corner Clamps](https://youtu.be/X4BSyZuc-ak){:target="_blank"} to help me attach the front, back and sides.

Notice that I use my own plans, although I printed them in black and white because my printer is dying.

Then I installed the bottom on the top...

...before realizing that the bottom actually belongs on the bottom...

And this is as far as I got today.

### And for those who missed this in the other places I posted it:

It does no good to have a cyclone system, if you don't empty out the bucket.

Because when the bucket gets full, the dust only has one place to go...

...and that's straight into the shop vac, and its filter.

Which then has to be cleaned.

In the rain.

Good times.
