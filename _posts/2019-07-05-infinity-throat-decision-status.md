I said in the [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-03-decoding-sawstops-finger-detection-system %}) that I'd post my final conclusions about the Infinity Throat Plate, so here I am. But I <span style="color:blue">***can't say for sure***</span> these are my final conclusions, so instead let's just say that this is where my mind is, right now.

### CDDS?

I've pretty-much decided that the [triggering of the "Contact Detected During Standby"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-06-23-my-infinity-throat-plate-plus-a-cross-cut-sled-triggers-sawstop's-warning-light %}) warning light pattern is a non-issue. It [doesn't appear to affect anything when actually running the saw]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-03-decoding-sawstops-finger-detection-system %}#-and-this-is-when-i-wanted-to-crawl-in-a-hole), so I guess it doesn't matter.

### Quality

I really like how well the Infinity Throat Plate itself is made, and it fits extremely well in the saw's throat. But I ***don't*** like the fact that the replaceable inserts don't match up perfectly with the top of the insert itself.

<span style="color:red">**The above picture is a terrible example**</span>, because if anything, it makes it look like the replaceable insert is *above* the top of the throat plate, when in reality <span style="color:blue">**it's slightly below the top of the throat plate**</span>.

But this is how the picture came out, and I don't want to manufacture evidence, so you'll just have to take my word for it.

In any case, when I have the throat plate aligned perfectly with the top of my saw, and I cut something narrow like a runner, the runner will hit the table at the rear of the insert. And while I can certainly raise the back end of the throat plate slightly, I shouldn't have to.

Someone on the [SawStop Users' Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sawstopusersgroup/){:target="_blank"} may be making CNC versions of the insert, and I may check them out when he gets them ready.

## Custom Insert Plates

I took a stab at creating my own insert plate out of plywood.

It fits absolutely perfectly, but the plywood's not perfectly flat (there's a slight twist in it), so I can't get it perfectly level. I don't have a planer or a jointer, so I can't mill my own lumber.

So I don't know if I'll go with the custom plate or not.

I have a new heat stamp with my logo on order, and I'll see how it looks.

## SawStop Dado Insert Plate

It turns out that the <span style="color:blue">**best of the bunch**</span> is the [SawStop TSI-DLD Dado Lock Down Insert Plate](https://amzn.to/2LFMLUw){:target="_blank"}. Check out my [article on how I cut the kerf](/sawstop/pcs/insert/stock/replace/).

This thing is absolutely perfect in the saw's throat. If it weren't $50 a pop (which doesn't sound that bad until you consider I'll have to buy more than one to handle all my kerf needs), it would be a no-brainer.

In the end, though, even at that price, <span style="color:blue">***it stands out as the best***</span>.

## So what will I do?

I'm actually thinking of using all three. I think I'll use the SawStop Dado insert most of the time. I'll probably use the Infinity plate for dados. And I may use my custom plate for miter cuts.

However, if the new heat stamp works well, then I may use my custom plate regardless of how flat it is. I have some new Baltic Birch plywood, so it *might* be better.

Don't you just love how decisive I can be? ðŸ™„

Later.
