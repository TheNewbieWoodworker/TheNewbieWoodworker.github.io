Sorry I didn't post yesterday. I was fighting a migraine. It's 4:40 AM, and this is what I got done yesterday.

This is the SketchUp model for the door facade.

The two "doors" are joined together with a tongue and groove joint, so the entire thing is one unit.

It doesn't really need two door pulls (aka "knobs"), but it looks better this way.

This is the parts breakdown.

Here's a look from the top, showing how the doors are joined:

Hopefully I'll get it cut and glued today, and post about it.

Later.
