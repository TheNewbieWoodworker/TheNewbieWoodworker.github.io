This is part 2 of assembling my new [SawStop PCS](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/sawstop-1-75-hp-professional-cabinet-saw-with-36-professional-t-glide-fence-system-pcs175-tgp236){:target="_blank"}. I left off with having just attached the cast iron wings:

Next up are the fence, rails, and extension table. The instructions are in the fence box.

Don't forget that the red fence handle is in the styrofoam. ðŸ™„

## Rails

Here's the rails.

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.04.jpg){: .align-left}
Even though the rails are heavy, it's pretty easy to put them on. You just start with one of the middle screws...

...then add another, and [Bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle){:target="_blank"}.

I used a digital angle gauge to help get both rails level. Don't know how much it helped, but I figured it couldn't hurt.

## Extension Table & Legs

Next up is the extension wing, which is made out of wood.

You add a couple of supports to the rails, and an attachment to the extension table...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.09.jpg){: .align-left}
...and attach it.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.10.jpg){: .align-left}
Attach the legs...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.11.jpg){: .align-left}
...and try to remember that the extension table is made out of wood - soft wood, so if you crank that ratchet too tight, you'll hear a "crack". ðŸ˜®

When you try and get the extension table flush with the extension wings, I recommend ***not*** using a beat-up old level as your straight edge - especially one that's not straight.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.13.jpg){: .align-left}
I finally used a straight edge that is *actually* straight. (The painters tape on the back is so it doesn't slide around, if I use it as a circular saw guide.)

But I have to tell you, it was ***NOT*** easy getting it aligned.

## Tube and fence

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.14.jpg){: .align-left}
The front tube that was covered in grease, so I had to be careful not to drop it while I took off the plastic wrap.

Attaching the tube was pretty easy when I used my roller stands again (taped to prevent them rolling, of course).

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.16.jpg){: .align-left}
You use the fence to determine the spacing between the tube and the rail...

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/assets/images-posts/2019-03-28.1.17.jpg){: .align-left}
...at both ends.

## Finishing up

I wheeled the table to its new home. The mobile base worked pretty well.

But that didn't mean I was done...

Some creative cardboard cutting let me get all the cardboard in the recycle trash bin.

And here it is, all comfy in its new home.
