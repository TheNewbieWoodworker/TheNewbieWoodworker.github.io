I've been kind of busy the last couple of days with other things, so I haven't gotten a lot done. On the other hand, it *feels* like I got a lot done, for some reason.

Here's what I got done:

(<span style="color:red">**A**</span>) Cut the lever slot.<br/>
(<span style="color:red">**B**</span>) Cut the hole for the power cord.<br/>
(<span style="color:red">**C**</span>) Cut and shaped the new lever.<br/>
(<span style="color:red">**D**</span>) Added the bicycle innertube rubber to keep the sawdust inside the housing.<br/>
(<span style="color:red">**E**</span>) And added the magnets.

Here's a few highlights:

### Cutting the Lever Slot

I cut the two sides of the lever slot on the table saw.

I placed a yellow stickie on the fence, so I could eyeball where the bottom of the blade was, so I didn't cut too far.

Then I finished with the band saw.

### The Bicycle Innertube

You can see here I've already added the magnets. I didn't record that, for some reason.

I cut up a portion of old bicycle innertube I got from a local bike shop for free...

...then stapled two overlapping pieces over the hole.

I had to use a hammer to get the staples all the way in, since Baltic Birch plywood is so hard.

### Putting it All Together
