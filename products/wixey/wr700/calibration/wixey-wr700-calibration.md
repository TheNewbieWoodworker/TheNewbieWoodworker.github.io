## About Imperial Decimal Places

The Wixey gauge's readout has two decimal places, or three if the value rounds to 5 thousands of an inch.

Compare that to my [digital caliper]({{ site.data.products.caliper-digital.link }}){:target="_blank"}, which has *three* decimal places, or *four* if the value rounds to 5 *ten*-thousands of an inch.

Those extra "5"s at the end of the numbers can be confusing. So, here's two ways to handle them:

1. Ignore the "5"s. That's a level of precision that's probably irrelevant to woodworking.

    --or--

1. If there *isn't* one of those "5"s, pretend there's an additional "0". That's what I'll do in the rest of this article.

## Typical Calibration Method

### Calibrate

Watch [this section of my video](https://youtu.be/wUaBOSx4--o?t=498){:target="_blank"}, if you don't want to read.

Here's the steps for calibrating the gauge.

1. Raise the blade.

1. Slide the fence over until it just "kisses" the blade, and lock it down. The blade should be able to spin, but just barely.

1. Press and hold the `ON/OFF/CAL` button for 3 seconds. This "zeroes the gauge".

1. Press the button again to store the value.

That's all you ***have*** to do.

### Verify

If you want to verify the calibration:

1. Cut a piece of scrap.

1. Measure the width of the cut piece, using a [digital caliper]({{ site.data.products.caliper-digital.link }}){:target="_blank"}.

1. Compare this number to the value on the Wixey readout. Remember the numbers are probably different resolutions, so don't forget the information in the [About Imperial Decimal Places](#about-imperial-decimal-places) section (above).

1. If the numbers are different enough that you care, follow the next steps.

### Adjust

<ol start="4"><li><p>Use the "+" or "-" buttons, depending on the whether the value you got in step #1 was positive or negative, to add or subtract increments of .005" until you've made up as much of the difference as possible.</p></li></ol>

<ol start="5">
<li><p>Press the button again to store the value.</p></li>
