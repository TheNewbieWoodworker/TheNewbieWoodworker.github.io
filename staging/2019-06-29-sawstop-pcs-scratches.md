title: "SawStop PCS Table Top Scratches"
layout: post

I bought my SawStop PCS about 3 months ago (wow how time flies). The cast iron top seems to get scratched awfully easily.

I haven't misused my table in any way, and in fact I can't even guess when I got most of these scratches.

For each of these pictures, you can click on them to open in a new window, then zoom in to full size.

In this first one, you can see some major scratches caused by the fence, as well as some others that weren't caused by the fence. I've checked the pad under the fence, and it feels smooth.

Here's some more random scratches. There's a lot more on the table than I'm showing here.
