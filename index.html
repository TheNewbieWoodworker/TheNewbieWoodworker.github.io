  Well, at least that's how I start all my YouTube videos. Because I'm all about helping newbie woodworkers overcome obstacles. Not that I'm that far removed from being a newbie myself... In fact, that's why the subject is close to my heart. I struggled, so why should you?

  Check out my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/thenewbiewoodworker) for the videos.

  If you're interested in plans, check out my [Plans section](plans).

  If you're interested in SketchUp, both for how to use it, and for my models, check out my [SketchUp Section](sketchup).
