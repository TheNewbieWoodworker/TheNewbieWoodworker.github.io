  Hey, Newbie Dan here!

  Well, at least that's how I start all my YouTube videos. Because I'm all about helping newbie woodworkers overcome obstacles. Not that I'm that far removed from being a newbie myself... In fact, that's why the subject is close to my heart. I struggled, so why should you?

  So go watch my videos at my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/thenewbiewoodworker), or if I've happened to actually post anything useful, feel free to read.
