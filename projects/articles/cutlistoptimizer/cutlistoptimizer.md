## Video

{% include youtube-player.html id="Q6zOD_U8Qz8" %}

Contains most of the information I have on CutList Optimizer.






<hr id="hownottoloseyourdata" class="hr-thick" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">



## <span style="color:red; font-size: 1.5em;">**!!**</span> How NOT to Lose Your Data

I talk about this in the video, but it bears repeating.

When you use any of the "Save" menu items, i.e. "Save Project" or "Save List", your data gets stored in your browser's cookies [^1].

And that means <span style="color:red">**your data could get deleted without you realizing it**</span>. For instance, if you clear your browser's history, it'll probably [^2] clear your CutList Optimizer's saved data.

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.04.jpg){: .image-border}{: .align-left}
So I recommend that you export your data to CSV files on your computer.

Click each of two menus circled in blue, and use the "Export" option (blue box).

You can still use the "Save" menu items, just make sure you have a recent copy of the lists exported also. Especially if you want to come back to the project at some point in the future.

## Sign In Button

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.05.jpg){: .image-border}{: .align-left}
A new "Sign In" button was added in the upper right, and I think it was added 2019-08-21.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.06.jpg){: .image-border}{: .align-left}
You must be signed in to save or load a project (or save or load a list).

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.07.jpg){: .image-border}{: .align-left}
If you're *not* signed in, you'll get a message saying that you must be signed in...

{:style="clear: left"}


[![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.08.jpg){: width="400px"}{: .image-border}](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.08.jpg){:target="_blank"}{: .align-left}
...and then you'll get this sign-in form.<br/>
*Click image to view full sized.*

{:style="clear: left"}

### Why do we need to sign in?

I honestly don't know. But I suspect it's a response to something in the [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/){:target="_blank"} regulations. All you have to do is read the [GDPR home page](https://eugdpr.org/){:target="_blank"} to see why I think this:

> **The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years.**
>
> <span style="color:red">The regulation will fundamentally reshape the way in which data is handled across every sector, from healthcare to banking and beyond.</span>

So, by forcing people to sign in before save and loading data from cookies [^3], the data in theory is protected by your sign-in information.

## SketchUp

If I learn of any plugins that allow you to export CSV files from SketchUp that can be used with CutList Optimizer, I'll post that here. And if you know of any, leave a comment and let me know. Thanks!





<hr id="errormessagesbugs" class="hr-thick">

<h2 id="-error-messages-bugs" style="margin-top: 30px"><span style="color:red">!!</span> Error Messages / Bugs</h2>

There's a couple of error messages that you might encounter, and I think <span style="color:red">**sometimes you get them as a result of a bug**</span>.

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.09.jpg){: .align-left}
I think this one means you can't run "Calculation" in multiple browser windows or tabs at the same time.

{:style="clear: left"}

![](/projects/articles/cutlistoptimizer/2019-08-14.1.10.jpg){: .align-left}
This one is kind of self-explanatory. I'd like to say this to people myself, sometimes. "*My brain is experiencing some issues. Try again later.*"

{:style="clear: left"}

If you receive either of the above error messages, and you can't get them to go away, it *might* be because of a bug in the website. It's happened to me a couple of times.

Some things to try:

1. Close your browser (not just the tab or window, but the program itself), then start it again. See if that helps.

1. Try a different browser, if you have one. Your data won't be there, but try a simple project and see if you still get the error message. If you don't, then continue with the next step.

1. Make sure you've exported your lists, then try clearing your browser's cookies for this website. [Here's an article](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cookies-for-one-site-4587347){:target="_blank"} that shows how to delete cookies for a specific website.

[^1]: Actually, the data isn't stored in cookies, it's stored in your browser's "Local Storage". If you don't know the difference, then don't worry about it. I just wanted to be pedantic to fend of other people with like tendencies.
[^2]: Whether or not the data gets cleared along with the history depends on which browser you're using, and possibly other options. But the point is still valid - your data may get deleted without you realizing it.
[^3]: See footnote #1, above.
