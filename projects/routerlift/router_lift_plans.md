## Buy the Plans (see below if you have problems):

For $5 (or the equivalent price in Euros), you can buy and download the plans. Your support really helps!

### IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS BUYING THE PLANS:

#### Try a different web browser
Try Chrome, or Firefox. 9 times out of 10, this is the problem.

#### Try a different URL
Try ordering from here: <https://gumroad.com/thenewbiewoodworker>{:target="_blank"}. If this solves your problem, I'd like to hear about it, if you don't mind. Totally optional, though. Click to send me an email: <{{ site.email }}>

### If that doesn't work:

I'm working very hard to solve any purchasing issues you might have. But I need your help to accomplish this.

So if you have problems, email me at <{{ site.email }}>. <br/>
If you can, please include any or all of the following information:

* What problem are you experiencing?
* What payment method are you trying to use?
   * DO **_NOT_** SEND ME YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER!
* What country are you trying this from?
* What error message(s) are you receiving?
* Screenshots help, if you know how to take them.
* What browser are you using?
* What Operating System are you using (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc)?
* Any other information you think might help.

I'll do my best to help solve the problem as quickly as possible.

If you don't receive a response within 24 hours, please leave a message in the comments below, because there may be an email issue of some sort.

Thanks!
