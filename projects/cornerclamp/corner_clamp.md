## Plans

For $5 (or the equivalent price in Euros), you can buy and download the plans for my Corner Clamp. Your support really helps!

#### [Click here for a preview](/projects/cornerclamp/preview).

### Purchase (see below if you have problems):
<script src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad-embed.js"></script>
<div class="gumroad-product-embed" data-gumroad-product-id="uqFKi"><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/uqFKi">Loading...</a></div>

<br/>
### IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS BUYING THE PLANS:

#### Try a different web browser
Try Chrome, or Firefox. 9 times out of 10, this is the problem.

#### Try a different URL
Try ordering from here: <https://gumroad.com/thenewbiewoodworker>{:target="_blank"}. If this solves your problem, I'd like to hear about it, if you don't mind. Totally optional, though. Click to send me an email: <dan@thenewbiewoodworker.com>
