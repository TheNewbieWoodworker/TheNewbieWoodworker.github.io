Here's the details on the new SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw (PCS) I bought recently.

## The Saw

I ended up buying the [1.75hp SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw with the 36" top and T-Glide fence](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/sawstop-1-75-hp-professional-cabinet-saw-with-36-professional-t-glide-fence-system-pcs175-tgp236){:target="_blank"}.

I don't think I need the 3hp model, and it's $430 more. I don't have room for anything bigger - I barely have room enough for this.

## The Deal

SawStop had a deal through April 30, 2019, where if you buy a PCS, you can get a free [Integrated Mobile Base](https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/professional-cabinet-saw-mobilty){:target="_blank"}:

or a free [Overarm Dust Collector](https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/overarm-dust-collection){:target="_blank"}:

#### The Dilemma

I didn't want that version of the overarm dust collector. If I ever get one, it'll be the [Floating Overarm Dust Collector](https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/floating-overarm-dust-collection-guard){:target="_blank"}. And I need wheels, so the decision was a no brainer - I wanted the mobile base.

The problem is, SawStop won't give you the free mobile base until *after* you buy the PCS. Once you get the PCS home and fill out the form with the serial number of your saw, they'll ship the base to you. So that means you have to keep the saw in boxes until your base gets there.

Stupid.

#### The Solution

I'm on the [SawStop Users' Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sawstopusersgroup/){:target="_blank"} on Facebook. One of the members mentioned that they work at a Woodcraft store, and they will send you home with the saw and the base, all together. They buy some extra bases and basically give them to you, then they fill out the rebate and SawStop sends them a new base.

Perfect.

## The Purchase

So I called the Woodcraft in Fountain Valley, CA, and mentioned the problem, and before I could say anything more, they told me about how they'd send me home with a saw and a base. So I took them up on it, and paid for the saw that evening (it was right before closing).

The next day I went and picked it up. And let me tell you, the owners there (I assume they're a married couple) are the nicest people you'll ever want to meet.

## The Box Dimensions

For anybody who wants to know the box dimensions, here they are. I rounded up to the nearest inch:
