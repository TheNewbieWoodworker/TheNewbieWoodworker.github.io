If you're new to my blog, here's some ways to get started:

### Start with the [first post]({{ site.posts.last.url }}).

{:style="margin-top: -1em"}
You can read forward using the navigation buttons, and it's pretty easy to skip over posts that don't interest you.

### Start with the [last post]({{ site.posts.first.url }}).

{:style="margin-top: -1em"}
Same as the previous, but in reverse. (You were expecting something else? ðŸ˜„)

### Start with the [first Powered Up post]({{ site.categories.PoweredUp.last.url }}).

{:style="margin-top: -1em"}
Skip all my meandering initial posts, and get right to the meaty stuff.

### Start with the [first project post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-21-powered-up-1-2-2 %}).

{:style="margin-top: -1em"}
Skip my initial thoughts on the Powered Up course, and go right to the start of my first project.
